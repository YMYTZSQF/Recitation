[01/13/2020] With a new year comes not only new beginnings but also fresh initiatives and expectations, and so it seems appropriate to include in this January issue a brief letter to announce the projects we have been working on at the AJA. Our mandate remains the same: to publish articles “devoted to the art and archaeology of ancient Europe and the Mediterranean world, including the Near East and Egypt, from prehistoric to Late Antique times.” [Link](https://www.ajaonline.org/editorial/174)

[01/21/2020] DRIVEN by wide-spread adoption of smart phones, tablets, and other wireless devices, mobile computing and communications systems have proliferated every aspect of human activity, playing an integral role in supporting national infrastructures  (e.g.,  smart  grids),  intelligent  transportation  and  aviation  networks,  financial  networks,  and  surveillance systems; and enabling a new era of pervasive computing, e-commerce, and health monitoring, among others.

[01/22/2020] Not many years ago, automation of document preparation and business communications was not taken seriously. Today many people recognize that business functions can be made much more efficient by automating these processes. Having realized that they are forms of information processing, the research community has adopted scientific approaches to developing efficient aids for these processes. A striking indicator of progress and maturity in this 
area is ACM's decision to establish a Transactions on Office Information Systems, which will begin publication in summer or fall 1982.

[01/31/2020] As Editor-in-Chief, I continue to welcome manuscripts on any subject within that broad definition, especially articles that announce discoveries, present new information, or break new theoretical ground, as well as those that address methodological issues, explore the symbiosis between field methodology and the analysis of material culture, or illuminate in novel ways the art and archaeology of the ancient world, extending occasionally beyond our traditional geographical and chronological scope.
